- "Data" contains the 3 data sets.
- "exploAccidents", "exploBreakdowns", "exploFires" there are my first explorations of the data.
- "Report" file is an RMarkdown that produces pdf files. We can use LaTeX expressions in it. 
- "biblio","CUP.bst" are used to create "Report". DO NOT MODIFY THEM
- ".gitignore" is just not to add useless things into repo. DO NOT MODIFY.
